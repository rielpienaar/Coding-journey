# Coding-journey

Entry 1 - 31 May 2021

Why learn to be a programmer?
- current work is not something that I want to do
- the return on investment (emotional, physical, intellectual and financial) is negative
- monotonous (same thing year in and year out)

How did I decide on this route?
- my wife works in the tech space and recommended I do a few tutorial on Youtube.
- my interest grew from there
- based on various options available, programming was the best option 
-- based on research: career prospects, learning opportunities, real-world problem solving and challenging myself

How am I learning?
- fell into the classic "Tutorial hell"
- decided to find websites with a lot of exercises after realising that watching tutorials is not going to cut it

What am I currently doing?
- got a membership licence from Datacamp
-- started with the Data Science in Python track, but realised that my Python skills are not good enough yeat
--- switched to the Python Programmer track
- doing challenges and quizzes on Hackerrank and W3School
-- a number of the exercises are not correctly classified for beginners
-- also no structured learning path
- Programming Hero app
-- tutorials and exercises
- lining up several experts to gain perspective on a learning path

What have I learned so far?
- patience
-- takes time to learn something new
- starting this 'blog' acts as a soundboard
- doing problem-solving challenges allows me to see where the gaps are
- must start with a project to apply skills in a real-life situation

The end
