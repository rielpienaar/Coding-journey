# Coding-journey

**Entry 1 - 31 May 2021**

Why learn to be a programmer?
- current work is not something that I want to do
- the return on investment (emotional, physical, intellectual and financial) is negative
- monotonous (same thing year in and year out)

How did I decide on this route?
- my wife works in the tech space and recommended I do a few tutorial on Youtube.
- my interest grew from there
- based on various options available, programming was the best option -- based on research: career prospects, learning opportunities, real-world problem solving and challenging myself

How am I learning?
- fell into the classic "Tutorial hell"
- decided to find websites with a lot of exercises after realising that watching tutorials is not going to cut it

What am I currently doing?
- got a membership licence from Datacamp -- started with the Data Science in Python track, but realised that my Python skills are not good enough yeat --- switched to the Python Programmer track
- doing challenges and quizzes on Hackerrank and W3School -- a number of the exercises are not correctly classified for beginners -- also no structured learning path
- Programming Hero app -- tutorials and exercises
- lining up several experts to gain perspective on a learning path

What have I learned so far?
- patience -- takes time to learn something new
- starting this 'blog' acts as a soundboard
- doing problem-solving challenges allows me to see where the gaps are
- must start with a project to apply skills in a real-life situation
**The end**


**Entry 2 - 15 June 2021**

Why the long absence?
- hectic time at work (setting up exams, sport related stuff)
- booked off with tonsilitis (could not do anything but sleep)

What have I done since Entry 1?
- continuing with the Python Programmer pathway on Datacamp
-- finished the Data Types module
--- not ure how I got through, everytime there is a data type relevant question I struggle to remember what to do #SuperFrustrating #TakesAWhileToFigureitOut
-- currently busy with the 'Data Manipulation with pandas' module
--- very interesting and a lot to remember

Did you speak to those expert(s)?
- Yes
-- spoke to Robert on Slack (ZATech) and he stated that I must join meetups (when it resumes #covidSucks), keep on coding, develop the soft skills (communication, etc.) and don't be a perfectionist #EasierSaidThanDone

How do you feel?
- frustrated that I keep struggling with the basic stuff (can't continue implement in later exercises)
- irritated that towardsdatascience is 'n ripoff -> have to pay $50 a year for access #Cheap
- need a study buddy

Plan of action
- continue with the exercises
-- with exams, I'll have more time to learn #Finally

**The end**
